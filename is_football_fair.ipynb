    "# Is Football Fair?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good question, isn't it? Seeing how Real Madrid wins their Champions League trophies (yes, I am a Barcelona fan) one might think it is not fair at all. Also, knowing that the game is low-scoring and luck plays quite a role in it, one might get to the same conclusion - the game isn't fair at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what do we mean by calling a game fair? In the end, if the team won, they fought for it, they deserved the victory and this victory is fair for them. From the other side, we have seen a lot of lucky goals or unfortunate errors that led to goals that made a decisive turn in the game. If favourite always wins - is it fair? Probably. But it is not that fun. From the other side, when outsider wins, is this fair?\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess the right answer will always be \"it depends\". It depends on an effort that a team put into their victory. If the team plays well and wins it is fair, correct? If the team can't even make a shot on the opponent's goal and loses, it is also fair, correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another story is when a team plays incredibly well, creates moments, attacks. but cannot score, while the opponent makes one shot, scores one goal and wins. This is totally unfair. These days we have the possibility to evaluate an effort that team made in every particular game and see if th result of that effort was fair.\n",
    "\n",
    "xG metric shows us an expected goal value for every shot in the game and usually it is a great indicator of an amount of moments the team created to score a goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have found a dataset with xG metrics for every game in the last few years in 40 different football leagues. More about where and how I got that data [here](https://medium.com/geekculture/scraping-xg-data-for-almost-any-league-in-the-world-9e9ddcc2a339?sk=3e422d47b778038eaab6bab7150dad7b).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan of action\n",
    "So, if the team created enough moments to score 2 goals and scored 2 - it is fair. If their opponent created moments for 1 goal and scored 1, the final result should've been 2-1 and the first team should have won. That's what we will call fair. We have to calculate the amount of games that ended up 'fairly' - if the xG of one team is bigger than the xG of another, the result has to be the victory of the first team. The same goes for draws - both teams created moments for 1 goals each, then draw is a fair result.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Obviously, the time of goal scoring is important in football, who scores first too, and many-many other factors. I am not pretending to be the judge of fairness, just a simple general look into data for a lot of games to see some basic trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the perfect and fair world if we were to compare xG results with actual results the compatibility should have been 100%, which means that all the games that ended up with one result or another based on xG, ended up the same in reality. Also, in such a world unicorns could have been possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that if 90% of the games won/drawn/lost by xG in reality ended up with the same result, we can call football fair. This number, 90%, is taken out of nothing and is subject to discussions. Also, probably, it might make sense to calculate this 'coefficient of fairness' in basketball and then apply it to football. As basket is a high-scoring game, the influence of luck is quite reduced here, meaning that normally a stronger team will win. Finding out the percentage of games that end up with xg_result=actual_result will create a benchmark for this 'coefficient of fairness'. Maybe that's a topic fo the next article. At the moment lets use the 90% benchmark.\n"

    "Anyway, what my conclusion is the following: we can claim that football is quite fair game as stronger team usually wins against weaker one. And even though the actual results of every particular game might not correspond to the expected ones, on the global scale, when we talk big numbers, we can see that the distribution of real outcomes and expected ones are quite similar, therefore the conclusion that football is fair makes sense (taking into account our benchmark of 90% of same outcomes or 10% of different outcomes)  "
